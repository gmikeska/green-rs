## Overview

Green.rs is a Rust library that provides a high-level interface for interacting with the Green cryptocurrency wallet system. It offers both synchronous and asynchronous APIs for:

- Transaction creation and management
- Address generation and validation
- UTXO management
- Wallet operations
- Fee estimation

The library is designed to be type-safe, efficient, and easy to use, leveraging Rust's powerful type system to prevent common errors at compile time.
